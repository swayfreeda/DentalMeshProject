GLViewer.h: defines the GLViewer class;
GLViewer.cpp: implement class members related to GLViewer class.

Mainwindow.h: defines the Mainwindow class
Mainwindow.cpp: implement class members related to Mainwindow class.

main.cpp: run the mainwindow classs 


GLViewer.cpp:  add <QGLFunctions> will undefine some functions in "glew.h", such as  glGenBuffers, glBindBuffer and glBufferData. I have found that, Qt has it's own version of 
              functions for buffer object, however it contains no functions about vertex array. And hence we have to inlcude "glew.h" for vertex array functions and include 
              <QGLFunctions> for buffer object fucntions. 

              Our Qt Version is 4.8.1, and only version >= 5.3 QTGLFunctions will contain complete functions such as glDrawElements....
